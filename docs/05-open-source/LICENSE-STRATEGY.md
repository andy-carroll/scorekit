# Licence Strategy

## Goal

Open-source the core platform under Apache 2.0 to maximise adoption and trust.

## Why Apache 2.0

- Permissive and widely adopted
- Encourages contributions and forks
- Suitable for agency/consultancy usage

## Packaging

- Free self-hosted core (Apache 2.0)
- Hosted managed edition (commercial)
- Lifetime Self‑Host Pro Templates + Support Pack (no compute included)

## BYO keys

- Self-host users provide their own AI/search keys (where applicable).
- This prevents compute abuse and keeps costs predictable.
