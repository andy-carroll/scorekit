# Vision

## The vision

Make premium scorecards/audits accessible, shareable, and deployable by any agency or consultancy—without paying a monthly SaaS tax or being locked into a vendor.

## Who it’s for

- Agencies and consultancies that use audits as lead magnets
- Operators who want to qualify leads and segment nurture
- Builders who want an extensible, open platform to create scorecards

## What makes it different

- Open-source core (Apache 2.0)
- Template-first structure (multiple ICPs/niches)
- Report quality and shareability as first-class features

## Success signals

- Users complete the assessment and share their score
- Assessments reliably trigger relevant follow-up flows (e.g., GHL sequences)
- Templates can be created without changing code
