# Brand Guidelines

## Goal

Prevent generic template UI. Establish a refined, elegant design system that can scale across templates.

## Scope

- Typography: font choices, scale, line heights
- Colour: palette, semantic tokens, contrast rules
- Spacing: rhythm, max-widths, page density
- Components: buttons, inputs, steps, cards, alerts
- Charts: score visualisation style and rules
- Motion: transitions, easing, duration
- Copy voice: calm, precise, no hype

## Non-negotiables

- Consistent spacing scale and typographic rhythm
- Strong trust signals (privacy note, what happens next)
- Mobile-first experience
- Share card design is part of the brand
