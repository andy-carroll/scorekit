# Overview

## Purpose

ScoreKit is a generic questionnaire/audit platform that produces a premium, shareable scorecard and report.

## Core user promise

In ~10 minutes, get clarity and a concrete focus roadmap that many providers charge £2k–£5k to deliver.

## Primary outputs

- On-page report (unlocked instantly after email capture)
- Shareable score and share card
- PDF delivered by email

## Key principles

- Deterministic scoring (answers drive score)
- Premium UX (no template slop)
- Template-first design (multiple niches/ICPs)
- Strong integration story (GHL tagging + workflows)
- Clear separation between platform docs and template docs

## Current scope

- V1: scorecard + report + PDF + sharing + GHL integration
- Post-V1: optional research appendix module with confirm/rerun/reject
